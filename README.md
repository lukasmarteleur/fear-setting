## What is Fear Setting?

Fear setting is a systematic exercise created by Tim Ferriss, inspired by the Stoic practice of "premeditatio malorum" (premeditation of evils). Unlike goal setting which focuses on positive outcomes, fear setting helps you:

- **Define** your worst-case scenarios in detail
- **Prevent** these scenarios from happening
- **Repair** the damage if they do occur

This process transforms vague anxieties into concrete, manageable action items.
